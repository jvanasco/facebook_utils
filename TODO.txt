ToDo
=======
- I think in the future, the 'dicts' that come back should be cast into a 'response' object, and there will be some metadata attached to it.
- Remove deprecated response parsing; everything seems to be JSON now
- Use (and re-use) requests' "Session" objects
- The Pyramid setup could/should use a per-request reified object via `add_request_method`

[ ] better catch the API errors and handle ratelimits, such as raising a `ApiRatelimitedError`
[ ] better tool on generating needed vars for the test 
[ ] strip out hashbang '#' on interactive tool
