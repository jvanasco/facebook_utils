0.17 (2013-05-7)
------------------
- added the following exception clases ( inheritance shown )

	ApiError
		ApiAuthError
			ApiAuthExpiredError
		ApiApplicationError
		ApiResponseError
		ApiRuntimeError
			ApiRuntimeVerirficationFormatError
			ApiRuntimeGrantError
			ApiRuntimeScopeError
			ApiRuntimeGraphMethodError
		ApiUnhandledError

- extended exceptions to include the originally raised error ( `raised` ) and the the `response` if available

- added format checking to the response during batch requests

- extended unit tests to ensure everything works.  they could be better

- consolidated the parsing of the response into the api_proxy.  facebook's graph has different response types and behaviors.  this helps consolidate it for developers.

- added `mask_unhandled_exceptions` kwarg to hub init.
	1. this defaults to False
	2. this is just testing.  please don't rely on it. it could go away.
	when set to True, it wraps uncaught exceptions in an ApiUnhandledError exception.  This allows you to only care about pass/fail if needed
