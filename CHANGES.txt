0.11 (2012-01-26)
------------------
- turned FacebookPyramid into a subclass of FacebookHub, and overloaded some methods with calls to the original.  This removed a need for staching a FacebookHub object.
- renamed two functions that improperly suggested their functionality.
-- deprecated 'graph__url_me' ; replaced with 'graph__url_me_for_access_token'
-- deprecated 'graph__get_profile' ; replaced with 'graph__get_profile_for_access_token'
- started planning real tests using ENV vars
